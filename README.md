# PyPrimality
A collection of primality testing algorithms and helper functions implemented first in SageMathCloud (now called CoCalc) and ported to Python 3

Also includes various other number theoretic functions ported from Sage/CoCalc to Python 3
Note syntax changes since CoCalc compiles Sage code natively in Python 2.
